<h2> Creating and Editing a DFSA </h2>

<p> In this section, we present a guide to creating and editing a deterministic finite-state automata. </p>

<p>
<h3> Choosing an Alphabet </h3> 
A DFSA has a single alphabet associated with it, &Sigma;. A DFSA is capable of determining if some
string over &Sigma;* belongs to the language described by the machine.
</p>

<p>
In the Configuration menu, click on <img src="../images/configureAlphabet.gif"> 
<i>Configure Alphabet</i>.  This will bring up the alphabet configuration dialog.  Check the boxes
for the symbols that you wish to include in your alphabet, and press <i>Ok</i>.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Adding States </h3>
To add a state, choose the <img src="../images/state.gif"> <i>Add States</i> mode from the Mode menu
or from the toolbar.  Now, clicking on an empty space in a machine window will create a state at
that location.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Adding Transitons </h3>
Select the <img src="../images/transition.gif"> <i>Add Transitions</i> mode from the Mode menu or
from the toolbar.  Click on a state, and drag the mouse to another state without releasing the mouse
button to create a transition between the two states.  Create self-loops by both clicking and
releasing the mouse on the same state. 
</p>

<p>
Each transition has an input symbol associated with it.  When the machine is in the 'from' state of 
a transition, and the symbol on the tape beneath the read/write head matches the input symbol of a
transition, then the machine follows the transition to the 'to' state, and looks at the next
character.  If there are no more characters, then the machine halts.
</p>

<p>
By default, the transition created has an <i>undefined</i> input symbol, '<i>!</i>', which matches
nothing, and will prevent the machine from running until replaced with a symbol from the machine
alphabet.  Additionally, every state must have exactly one transition leaving it using every symbol
in &Sigma;.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Choosing Transition Symbols </h3>
Click on the input or output symbol of a transition, and on your keyboard type the character that
you want to change the symbol to be.  You may only change the symbol to characters that belong to
the alphabet of the machine.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Deleting States and Transitions</h3>
Choose the <img src="../images/eraser.gif"> <i>Eraser</i> mode from the Mode menu or toolbar.  Click
on a state or transition to erase it.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Moving States and Transitions </h3> 
Click on a state and drag it to move it to another location.  Transitions can be moved similarly by
clicking on their action text or the directional arrows and dragging.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Choosing a Start State </h3>
Select the <img src="../images/startState.gif"> <i>Choose Start State</i> mode from the Mode menu.
Click on a state to toggle whether it is a start state or not.  Only one state may be a start
state.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Choosing an Accepting State </h3>
Select the <img src="../images/finalState.gif"> <i>Choose Accepting State</i> mode from the Mode
menu.  Click on a state to toggle whether it is an accepting state or not.  A DFSA may have any
number of accepting states.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Copying and Pasting </h3> 
A set of states can be selected by dragging a box around them in the <img src="../images/selection.gif">
<i>Make Selection mode</i>.  To add or remove states from the current set of selected states, click
on them while holding the shift key.  All transitions that connect only to other states within the
set of selected states are automatically selected.
</p>

<p>
These selected states and transitions can now be cut, copied and pasted using the appropriate items
from the Edit menu.  Pasted states are renamed to the first free name that has not yet been used in
this machine to prevent duplication of names.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Renaming States </h3>
To give a state a custom name, click once on its name.  This brings up the appropriate dialog box.
States must be uniquely named within a machine - duplicate names are not allowed.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Loading and Saving Machines </h3>
Machines can be saved to a hard disk or other storage medium by selecting <img src="../images/saveMachine.gif"> 
<i> Save Machine </i> from the <i>File</i> menu.  Choose <img src="../images/openMachine.gif">
<i>Open Machine </i> from the <i>File</i> menu to retrieve a machine later.
