<h2> Editing the Tape </h2>

<p>
The tape is displayed in the bottom portion of the window.  The darkened cell represents the
location of the read/write head, and the '*' symbol indicates that the first cell of the tape is the
cell immediately to the right.  The tape extends infinitely in the rightwards direction (at least,
as far as the memory limitations of the system will allow).
</p>

<p>
This guide describes how to manually write data to the tape for processing by a machine.
</p>

<p>
In this program, there is only one tape, and the tape is shared with all machines that are currently
open.  There is only ever one read/write head on this tape, and the read/write head is shared
between all machines.  However, the user can manually position the read/write head and edit the
tape.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Moving the Read/Write Head </h3>
Use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard or the arrow buttons, <img src="../images/tapeLeft.gif">  
and <img src="../images/tapeRight.gif">, on either side of the tape to move the head one cell at a
time.  You may also click on a cell to jump the read/write head to that cell.  The left-most button
near the tape, <img src="../images/tapeStart.gif">, (also available from the <i>Tape</i> menu) sends the
read/write head back to the very first cell.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Writing Symbols to the Tape </h3>
The read/write head acts as a cursor for you to modify the tape with.  Simply type the character on
your keyboard to have the corresponding symbol appear on the tape in the location of the read/write
head.  To type a blank character, press spacebar or '_'.  The backspace key also functions as you
would expect it to.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Loading and Saving a Tape  </h3>
Use the <img src="../images/openTape.gif"> <i>Open Tape</i>, <img src="../images/saveTape.gif">
<i>Save Tape</i> and <i>Save Tape As</i> items in the <i>File</i> menu to load and save a tape.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Reloading the Tape </h3>
Often when you are debugging a machine, you may wish to repeatedly apply the same tape input
to the machine.  It is tedious to re-enter the tape input data manually, or repeatedly have to
select the same file to load.  Hence, an option is provided to reload the tape to the state it was
in when it was last saved.  If the tape has not been saved, using this option is equivalent to
erasing the tape.  To reload the tape, press the <img src="../images/tapeReload.gif"> <i>Reload Tape</i>
button near the bottom right of the window, or select <img src="../images/tapeReload.gif"> <i>Reload Tape</i>
from the <i>Tape</i> Menu.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Erasing the Tape </h3>
To clear the tape contents, press the <img src="../images/tapeClear.gif"> <i>Erase Tape</i> button
at the bottom-right of the screen, or in the <i>Tape</i> menu.  Choosing <img
src="../images/newTape.gif"> <i>New Tape</i> from the <i>File</i> menu also has the effect of
erasing the tape.
