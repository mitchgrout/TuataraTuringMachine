<h2> Overview of Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator </h2>
<p>
This program is a graphical toolkit for designing and simulating Turing machines.  It was written by
Jimmy Foulds during 2006-2007, and later updated and extended by Mitchell Grout during 2017-2018,
with funding from the Department of Mathematics at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.

Turing machines are a class of abstract machines which are commonly believed to be capable of
performing any computation that is specifiable by an algorithm.
</p>

<p>
A Turing machine operates by reading and modifying a tape of data.  Here, a "tape" is a sequence of
cells that contain symbols from some alphabet.  This is achieved via a "read/write head", which can
move left or right along the tape, reading or modifying one cell at a time.
</p>

<p>
Turing machines consist of a set of states (sometimes known as "nodes"), and a set of transitions
between the states.  Each transition specifies an "input symbol" and an action.  If the machine is
in a particular state, and there is an outgoing transition for which the input symbol matches the
symbol on the tape in the location of the read/write head, the action is performed and the machine
changes state to the state specified by the transition. 
</p>

<p>
If there is no outgoing transition from the current state with an input symbol that matches the
current symbol on the tape, the computation halts. 
</p>

<p>
There exist alternate models for Turing machines, where actions are associated with states instead
of with transitions.  These models are not covered in this piece of software. 
</p>

<p>
In Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator, the tape has a "first" cell at the left end of the tape, but
has no "last" cell - the tape extends infinitely to the right.  For a computation to complete
successfully, the machine should "park" the head in the first cell at the end of the computation.
Other models exist where the tape extends infinitely to the left as well as to the right (a "doubly
infinite tape"), but this is not the approach taken here.
