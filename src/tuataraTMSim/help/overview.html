<h2> Overview of Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator </h2>
<p>
This program is a graphical toolkit for designing and simulating various types of deterministic
finite-state machines.  This program is intended to help understand how finite-state machines work,
aid in simulating them, and to act as a teaching resource.  This program was originally written by
Jimmy Foulds during 2006-2007, and later updated by Mitchell Grout in 2017-2018, with funding from
the Department of Mathematics at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.

Finite-state machines are a mathematical model of computation, with applications ranging from string
matching to simulating algorithms.  A finite-state machine typically consists of the following
components:
<ul>
    <li> A finite alphabet of symbols recognized by the machine, &Sigma;
    <li> A finite set of states, <i>Q</i>
    <li> A transition function, which dictates which state the machine should move to given its
         state, &delta;
    <li> At least one start state; if this is unique, it is normally denoted <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>,
         otherwise if there is more than one, <i>S</i> &sube; <i>Q</i>
    <li> A set of final states, <i>F</i> &sube; <i>Q</i>.  If there is only one final state, it is
         normally denoted <i>q<sub>f</sub></i>.
</ul>
To visualise a machine, we do the following:
<ul>
    <li> A state is drawn as a circle, and is given a label.
    <li> If a state is a start state, we draw a curved arrow coming into the state.
    <li> If a state is a final state, we draw a smaller circle inside the state.
    <li> If &delta; defines a transition from state <i>x</i> to state <i>y</i>, then we draw an
         arrow leaving <i>x</i> and arriving at <i>y</i>.  Depending on the type of machine, we will
         also draw an 'action' alongside this arrow.
</ul>
All finite-state machines may be either deterministic, or nondeterministic.  A deterministic machine
will, for the same input, always produce the same output.  In contrast, a nondeterministic machine
may produce different output for the same input.  Tuatara supports both deterministic and
nondeterministic machines, but in order to avoid any confusion, requires the user to manually deal
with nondeterministic behaviour via a graphical prompt.

Below is a list of finite-state machines currently supported by Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator.

<h3> Turing Machines (TM) </h3>
A Turing machine is a class of abstract machine which is considered to be capable of performing any
computation that is specifiable by an algorithm.  
</p>

<p>
Formally, we define a Turing machine to be the 5-tuple
<i>M</i> = (<i>Q</i>, &Sigma;, &delta;, <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>q<sub>f</sub></i>),
with the usual definition for each symbol.  The transition function, &delta;, is defined as follows:
<ul>
    <li> &delta; : <i>Q</i> &times; &Sigma; &rarr; <i>Q</i> &times; (&Sigma; &cup; {L, R}) 
         -- i.e. &delta; is a function which takes a state from <i>Q</i>, a letter from &Sigma;, and
         produces a new state from <i>Q</i>, and either another letter from &Sigma;, or the distinct
         symbol 'L' or 'R'.
    <li> &delta; is a partial function, meaning it may not be defined for some inputs.
    <li> &delta;(<i>q<sub>f</sub></i>, <i>y</i>) is undefined for all <i>y</i> &isin; &Sigma; 
         -- i.e. the unique halt state does not have any arrows leaving it.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If &delta;(<i>q</i>, <i>x</i>) = (<i>q'</i>, <i>y</i>), then we have an arrow leaving state <i>q</i>
and arriving at state </i>q'</i>.  Along with this arrow, we write '<i>x</i>/<i>y</i>', indicating
that the arrow will be used if the read/write head is looking at the character <i>x</i> on the tape,
and will write <i>y</i> back to the tape.  If instead <i>y</i> is either 'L' or 'R', then the
read/write head is moved left or right by one cell respectively.
</p>

<p>
A Turing machine comes equipped with an infinitely large tape, in which individual cells can be read
and overwritten.  The tape extends infinitely to the right.  Additionally, we have a read/write head
which is initially over the left-most cell of the tape, and is capable of reading a symbol from the
tape, writing a symbol, and moving along the tape.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM) </h3>
Nondeterministic Turing Machines are a superset of Turing Machines, i.e. they have the same
definition, but with relaxed rules.
</p>

<p>
Formally, we define a Nondeterministic Turing machine to be the 5-tuple
<i>M</i> = (<i>Q</i>, &Sigma;, &delta;, <i>S</i>, <i>F</i>),
with the usual definition for each symbol.  The transition function, &delta;, is defined as follows:
<ul>
    <li> &delta; : <i>Q</i> &times; &Sigma; &rarr; 2<sup><i>Q</i> &times; (&Sigma; &cup; {L, R})</sup>
         -- i.e. &delta; is a function which takes a state from <i>Q</i>, a letter from &Sigma;, and
         produces a set of states from <i>Q</i> and symbols from &Sigma;, or the distinct symbols
         'L' or 'R'.  This set constitutes all of the potential transitions that the machine could
         take from the given state with the given input.
    <li> For all <i>q<sub>f</sub></i> &isin; <i>F</i>, we allow &delta;(<i>q<sub>f</sub></i>, y) to
         be defined -- i.e. halt states are permitted to have arrows leaving them.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Like deterministic Turing machines, nondeterministic Turing machines are equipped with an infinitely
large tape, along with a read/write head, and use the tape in the same fashion as their
deterministic counterparts.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Deterministic Finite-State Automata (DFSA) </h3>
A DFSA is a class of abstract machine which is capable of determining if a string belongs to some
regular language.  We denote the language accepted by a DFSA <i>M</i> to be 
L(<i>M</i>) &sube; &Sigma;*.
</p>

<p>
Formally, we define a DFSA to be the 5-tuple
<i>M</i> = (<i>Q</i>, &Sigma;, &delta;, <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>F</i>)</i>, 
with the usual definition for each symbol.  The transition function, &delta;, is defined as follows:
<ul>
    <li> &delta; : <i>Q</i> &times; &Sigma; &rarr; <i>Q</i> -- i.e. &delta; is a function which takes
         a state from <i>Q</i>, a letter from &Sigma;, and produces a new state from <i>Q</i>.
    <li> &delta; is a total function, meaning it is defined for every possible combination of
         <i>Q</i> and &Sigma;.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If &delta;(<i>q</i>, <i>x</i>) = <i>q'</i>, then we have an arrow leaving state <i>q</i> and
arriving at state </i>q'</i>.  Along with this arrow, we write <i>'x'</i>, indicating that the arrow
will be used if the current character being read is <i>x</i>.
</p>

<p>
A DFSA takes as input some string <i>u</i> &isin; <i>&Sigma;*</i>, reading each symbol from
left-to-right, and determines whether or not <i>u</i> &isin; L(<i>M</i>).
</p>

<p>
<h3> Nondeterministic Finite-State Automata (NFSA) </h3>
NFSAs are a superset of DFSAs, i.e. they have the same definition, but with relaxed rules.
</p>

<p>
Formally, we define a NFSA to be the 5-tuple
<i>N</i> = (<i>Q</i>, &Sigma;, &delta;, <i>S</i>, <i>F</i>),
with the usual definition for each symbol.  The transition function, &delta;, is defined as follows:
<ul>
    <li> &delta; : <i>Q</i> &times; &Sigma; &rarr; 2<sup><i>Q</i></sup> -- i.e. &delta; is a
        function which takes a state from <i>Q</i>, a letter from &Sigma;, and produces a subset of
        states from <i>Q</i>.  This set constitutes all of the potential transitions that the
        machine could take from the given state with the given input.
</ul>

<p>
Depending on which transitions are used during execution, the output of a NFSA for a given input
string <i>u</i> &isin; &Sigma;*, could either be a 'yes' or 'no'.  However, if there exists at least one path through the
machine which gives a 'yes', then the input <i>u</i> &isin; L(<i>N</i>).
