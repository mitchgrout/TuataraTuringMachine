<h2> Executing Machines </h2>

<p>
After designing a machine using this program, it may be useful to run it with some given input to
determine how the machine behaves, and to determine whether or not it is correct.

<p>
Given that Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator is designed for teaching purposes, frequently we
also like to see exactly how our machine arrives at its output - what steps were involved, and why
those steps took place.  Hence, simulating the execution of machines step-by-step is part of
the core functionality of this program.
</p>

<p>
This guide explains in detail how to control the simulation of your shiny new machines. 
</p>

<p> 
<h3> Validating a machine </h3>
To ensure that the current machine is deemed deterministic, select 
<img src="../images/validate.png"> <i>Validate</i> from the <i>Machine</i> menu or toolbar.  This
will ensure that there is no nondeterministic behaviour in the machine such as duplicate edges,
multiple start states, or missing edges. 

<p>
<h3> Stepping a machine </h3>
To make the current machine step through one single operation, choose the <img src="../images/step.png"> 
<i>Step</i> item from the <i>Machine</i> menu or the toolbar.  The machine will complete the
operation specified by one transition.  The tape and the state of the machine will be updated
accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Executing a machine </h3> 
Select <img src="../images/fastExecute.png"> <i>Execute</i> from the <i>Machine</i> menu or
toolbar to start the simulation running.  The machine's execution will occur continuously and
automatically until the computation halts (in error or otherwise) or the user presses the stop or
pause buttons.  The <img src="../images/stop.png"> <i>Stop Execution </i> and <img src="../images/pause.png">
<i>Pause Execution</i> buttons are also located in the <i>Machine</i> menu and toolbar.</p>

<p>
<h3> Changing Execution Speeds </h3>
The speed of execution can be controlled via the options in the <i>Machine</i> menu.  This is
useful for debugging or learning purposes, or to reduce the waiting time for a computation to
complete.  The speed cannot be modified during automatic execution.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Choosing the Current State </h3>
The current state of the machine can be modified using the <img src="../images/currentState.png"> 
<i>Choose Current State</i> mode, found in the <i>Mode</i> menu and toolbar.  This is useful for
debugging and exploring 'what-if' scenarios.  When in this mode, click on a state to select it as
the current state.  
</p>

<p>
<h3> Machine Configurations </h3>
The execution of a machine can be described by a sequence of configurations.  How these
configurations are expressed is entirely machine dependent.
<br><b>Turing machine:</b> The configuration of a Turing machine is a triple, (<i>u, q, v</i>),
where <i>uv</i> &isin; <i>Y*</i> is the current tape contents, <i>q</i> is the current state, and
the read/write head sits above the first symbol of <i>v</i>.
<br><b>DFSA:</b> The configuration of a DFSA is a double, (<i>q, c</i>), where <i>q</i> is the
current state, and <i>c</i> is the current symbol being read.  If <i>q</i> is an accepting state,
then <i>c</i> is omitted.
</p>

<p>
Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator will log the configuration sequence of a machine as it executes. 
The sequence is logged to the console, which is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
