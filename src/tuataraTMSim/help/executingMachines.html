<h2> Executing Machines </h2>

<p>
After designing a machine using this program, it may be useful to run it with some given input to
determine how the machine behaves, and to determine whether or not it is correct.

<p>
Given that Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator is designed for teaching purposes, frequently we
also like to see exactly how our machine arrives at its output - what steps were involved, and why
those steps took place.  Hence, simulating the execution of machines step-by-step is part of
the core functionality of this program.
</p>

<p> 
<h3> Validating a machine <img src="../images/validate.png"> </h3>
As Tuatara supports both deterministic and nondeterministic machines, it may be useful to validate
that the current machine being designed is deemed determininstic.  To validate a machine, select 
<i>Machine > Validate</i>.  This will ensure that the current machine does not have any
nondeterministic qualities, such as duplicate edges, no start states, etc.

<p>
<h3> Stepping a machine <img src="../images/step.png"> </h3>
To make the current machine step through one single operation, select <i>Machine > Step</i>.
The machine will complete the operation specified by exactly one transition.  The tape and the state
of the machine will be updated accordingly.
</p>

                         <img src="../images/stop.png"> </h3> 
To automatically step through the machine until it halts, select <i>Machine > Execute</i>.  The
machine's execution will occur automatically until it is either paused via 
<i>Machine > Pause Execution</i> or reset via <i>Machine > Stop Execution</i>.  The speed of
execution can be controlled via the options in the <i>Machine</i> menu.  This is useful for
debugging or learning purposes, or to reduce the waiting time for a computation to complete.  The
speed cannot be modified during automatic execution.
</p>

<p>
<h3> Choosing the Current State <img src="../images/currentState.png"> </h3>
The current state of the machine can be modified by selecting <i>Mode > Choose Current State</i>.
This is useful for debugging and exploring 'what-if' scenarios.  When in this mode, click on a state
to select it as the current state.  
</p>

<p>
<h3> Machine Configurations </h3>
The execution of a machine can be described by a sequence of configurations.  How these
configurations are expressed is entirely machine dependent.
<br><b>Turing machine:</b> The configuration of a Turing machine is a triple, (<i>u, q, v</i>),
where <i>uv</i> &isin; <i>&Sigma;*</i> is the current tape contents, <i>q</i> &isin; <i>Q</i> is 
the current state, and the read/write head sits above the first symbol of <i>v</i>.
<br><b>DFSA:</b> The configuration of a DFSA is a double, (<i>q, c</i>), where <i>q</i> is the
current state, and <i>c</i> is the current symbol being read.  If the end of the tape is reached,
<i>c</i> is omitted.
</p>

<p>
Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator will log the configuration sequence of a machine as it executes. 
The sequence is logged to the console, which is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
