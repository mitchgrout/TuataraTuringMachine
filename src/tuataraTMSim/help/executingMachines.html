<H2> Executing Machines </H2>

<P> It's all very well designing a Turing machine using a computer program, but typically we want to
do a little more than this.  We usually would like to know how our machine behaves when given
certain inputs.
</P>
<P> Given that Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator is designed for teaching purposes, frequently we
also like to see exactly how our machine arrives at its output - what steps were involved, and why
those steps took place.  Hence, simulating the execution of Turing machines step-by-step is part of
the core functionality of this program.
</P>
<P> This guide explains in detail how to control the simulation of your shiny new Turing machines. </P>

<H3> Stepping a machine </H3>
<P> To make the current machine step through one single operation, choose the <IMG SRC="../images/step.gif"> 
<I>Step</I> item from the <I>Machine</I> menu or the toolbar.  The machine will complete the
operation specified by one transition.  The tape and the state of the machine will be updated
accordingly.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Executing a machine </H3>
<P> Select <IMG SRC="../images/fastExecute.gif"> <I>Execute</I> from the <i>Machine</I> menu or
toolbar to start the simulation running.  The machine's execution will occur continuously and
automatically until the computation halts (in error or otherwise) or the user presses the stop or
pause buttons.  The <IMG SRC="../images/stop.gif"> <I>Stop Execution </I> and <IMG SRC="../images/pause.gif">
<I>Pause Execution</I> buttons are also located in the <I>Machine</I> menu and toolbar.</P>

<BR>
<H3> Changing Execution Speeds </H3>
<P> The speed of execution can be controlled via the options in the <I>Machine</I> menu.  This is
useful for debugging or learning purposes, or to reduce the waiting time for a computation to
complete.  The speed cannot be modified during automatic execution.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Choosing the Current State </H3>
<P> The current state of the machine can be modified using the <IMG SRC="../images/currentState.gif"> 
<I>Choose Current State</I> mode, found in the <I>Mode</I> menu and toolbar.  This is useful for
debugging and exploring 'what-if' scenarios.  When in this mode, click on a state to select it as
the current state.  
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Non-deterministic Turing Machines </H3>
<P> This program has no support for non-deterministic machines.  Prior to simulating the machine,
the machine will be first validated for non-determinism and other inconsistencies, and if none are
found, will proceed with the simulation.
