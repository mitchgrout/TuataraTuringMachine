<H2> Creating and Editing Machines </H2>

<P> In this section, we present a task-oriented ("how-to") guide to creating and editing machines.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Choosing an Alphabet </H3>
<P> Each machine has an alphabet assocated with it.  This is the set of symbols that it can read and
write to the tape.  In this program, unlike in some Turing machine models there are not separate
alphabets for allowable input ("input alphabet") and symbols that the machine can write to the tape
("tape alphabet").  Instead, consider the single alphabet to be the union of these two alphabets.
</P>
<P>In the Alphabet menu, click on <IMG SRC="../images/configureAlphabet.gif"> <I>Configure Alphabet</I>.
This will bring up the alphabet configuration dialog.  Check the boxes for the symbols that you wish
to include in your alphabet, and press <I>Ok</I>.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Adding States </H3>
<P>To add a state, choose the <IMG SRC="../images/state.gif"> <I>Add States</I> mode from the Mode
menu or from the toolbar.  Now, clicking on an empty space in a machine window will create a state
at that location.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Adding Transitons </H3>
<P> Select the <IMG SRC="../images/transition.gif"> <I>Add Transitions</I> mode from the Mode menu
or from the toolbar.  Click on a state, and drag the mouse to another state without releasing the
mouse button to create a transition between the two states.  Create self-loops by both clicking and
releasing the mouse on the same state.
</P>
<P> Each transition has an input symbol (to the left of the <I>/</I>), and an action symbol (to the
right of the <I>/</I>).  When the machine is in the 'from' state of a transition, and the symbol on
the tape beneath the read/write head matches the input symbol of a transition, the action defined by
the action symbol may be performed and the machine state is set to the 'to' state of the transition.
</P>
<P> By default, the transition created has an <I>undefined</I> input symbol, '<I>!</I>', which
matches nothing, and will prevent the machine from running until replaced with a symbol from the
machine alphabet.  The output action defaults to the <I>epsilon</I> action, the empty action which
causes no change to be made to the tape.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Choosing Transition Symbols </H3>
<P> Click on the input or output symbol of a transition, and on your keyboard type the character
that you want to change the symbol to be.  You may only change the symbol to characters that belong
to the alphabet of the machine, or one of the special symbols described below.  If the blank symbol
is in the alphabet, you may type this character by pressing the spacebar button or the underscore
key '<I>_</I>'.
</P>
<P> A useful input symbol is the <I>otherwise</I> symbol, '<I>?</I>', which matches any symbol, but
only if no other transition's input symbol matches.  A machine cannot have several <I>otherwise</I>
transitions.
</P>
<P> Empty epsilon actions are created by pressing '<I>Shift + E</I>' when the action symbol is
selected.  These actions cause no change to the tape.
</P>
<P> Set the action to move the read/write head left or right by typing the <I>left</I> and
<I>right</I> arrow keys, respectively.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Deleting States and Transitions</H3>
<P> Choose the <IMG SRC="../images/eraser.gif"> <I>Eraser</I> mode from the Mode menu or toolbar.
Click on a state or transition to erase it.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Moving States and Transitions </H3>
<P> Click on a state and drag it to move it to another location.  Transitions can be moved similarly
by clicking on their action text or the directional arrows and dragging.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Choosing Start States </H3>
<P> Select the <IMG SRC="../images/startState.gif"> <I>Choose Start States</I> mode from the Mode
menu.  Click on a state to toggle whether it is a start state or not.  Only one state may be a start
state.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Choosing Accepting States </H3>
<P> Select the <IMG SRC="../images/finalState.gif"> <I>Choose Accepting States</I> mode from the
Mode menu.  Click on a state to toggle whether it is an accepting state or not.  Only one state may
be an accepting state.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Copying and Pasting </H3>
<P> A set of states can be selected by dragging a box around them in the <IMG SRC="../images/selection.gif">
<I>Make Selection mode</I>.  To add or remove states from the current set of selected states, click
on them while holding the shift key.  All transitions that connect only to other states within the
set of selected states are automatically selected.
</P>
<P> These selected states and transitions can now be cut, copied and pasted using the appropriate
items from the Edit menu.  Pasted states are renamed to the first free name that has not yet been
used in this machine to prevent duplication of names.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Renaming States </H3>
<P> To give a state a custom name, click once on its name.  This brings up the appropriate dialog
box.  States must be uniquely named within a machine - duplicate names are not allowed.
</P>

<BR>
<H3> Loading and Saving Machines </H3>
<P> Machines can be saved to a hard disk or other storage medium by selecting <IMG SRC="../images/saveMachine.gif"> 
<I> Save Machine </I> from the <I>File</I> menu.  Choose <IMG SRC="../images/openMachine.gif"> <I>Open Machine </I>
from the <I>File</I> menu to retrieve a machine later.
</P>
